  BUMBLE BEE
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
As I lay yonder in tall grass<BR>
A drunken bumble-bee went past<BR>
Delirious with honey toddy.<BR>
The golden sash about his body<BR>
Could scarce keep in his swollen belly<BR>
Distent with honey-suckle jelly.<BR>
Rose liquor and the sweet pea wine<BR>
Had filled his soul with song divine;<BR>
Deep had he drunk the warm night through:<BR>
His hairy thighs were wet with dew.<BR>
Full many an antic he had played<BR>
While the world went round through sleep and shade.<BR>
Oft had he lit with thirsty lip<BR>
Some flower-cup's nectared sweets to sip,<BR>
When on smooth petals he would slip<BR>
Or over tangled stamens trip,<BR>
And headlong in the pollen rolled,<BR>
Crawl out quite dusted o'er with gold.<BR>
Or else his heavy feet would stumble<BR>
Against some bud and down he'd tumble<BR>
Amongst the grass; there lie and grumble<BR>
In low, soft bass&mdash;poor maudlin bumble!<BR>
With tipsy hum on sleepy wing<BR>
He buzzed a glee&mdash;a bacchic thing<BR>
Which, wandering strangely in the moon,<BR>
He learned from grigs that sing in June,<BR>
Unknown to sober bees who dwell<BR>
Through the dark hours in waxen cell.<BR>
When south wind floated him away<BR>
The music of the summer day<BR>
Lost something: sure it was a pain<BR>
To miss that dainty star-light strain.<BR>

  WATER LILIES AT SUNSET
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Mine eyes have seen when once at sunset hour<BR>
White lily flocks that edged a lonely lake<BR>
All rose and sank upon the lifting swell<BR>
That swayed their long stems lazily, and lapped<BR>
Their floating pads and stirred among the leaves.<BR>
And when the sun from western gates of day<BR>
Poured colored flames, they, kissed to ruddy shame,<BR>
So blushed through snowy petals, that they glowed<BR>
Like roses morning-blown in dewy bowers,<BR>
When garden-walks lie dark with early shade.<BR>
That so their perfumed chalices were brimmed<BR>
With liquid glory till they overflowed<BR>
And spilled rich lights and purple shadows out,<BR>
That splashed the pool with gold, and stained its waves<BR>
In tints of violet and ruby blooms.<BR>
But when the flashing gem that lit the day<BR>
Dropped in its far blue casket of the hills,<BR>
The rainbow paintings faded from the mere,<BR>
The wine-dark shades grew black, the gilding dimmed,<BR>
While, paling slow through tender amber hues,<BR>
The crimsoned lilies blanched to coldest white,<BR>
And wanly shivered in the evening breeze.<BR>
When twilight closed&mdash;when earliest dew-drops fell<BR>
All frosty-chill deep down their golden hearts,<BR>
They shrank at that still touch, as maidens shrink,<BR>
When love's first footstep frights with sweet alarms<BR>
The untrod wildness of their virgin breasts;<BR>
Then shut their ivory cups, and dipping low<BR>
Their folded beauties in the gloomy wave,<BR>
They nodded drowsily and heaved in sleep.<BR>
But sweeter far than summer dreams at dawn,<BR>
Their mingled breaths from out the darkness stole,<BR>
Across the silent lake, the winding shores,<BR>
The shadowy hills that rose in lawny slopes,<BR>
The marsh among whose reeds the wild fowl screamed,<BR>
And dusky woodlands where the night came down.<BR>

  BETWEEN THE FLOWERS
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
An open door and door-steps wide,<BR>
With pillared vines on either side,<BR>
And terraced flowers, stair over stair,<BR>
Standing in pots of earthenware<BR>
Where stiff processions filed around&mdash;<BR>
Black on the smooth, sienna ground.<BR>
Tubers and bulbs now blossomed there<BR>
Which, in the moisty hot-house air,<BR>
Lay winter long in patient rows,<BR>
Glassed snugly in from Christmas snows:<BR>
Tuberoses, with white, waxy gems<BR>
In bunches on their reed-like stems;<BR>
Their fragrance forced by art too soon<BR>
To mingle with the sweets of June.<BR>
(So breathes the thin blue smoke, that steals<BR>
From ashes of the gilt pastilles,<BR>
Burnt slowly, as the brazier swings,<BR>
In dim saloons of eastern kings.)<BR>
I saw the calla's arching cup<BR>
With yellow spadix standing up,<BR>
Its liquid scents to stir and mix&mdash;<BR>
The goldenest of toddy-sticks;<BR>
Roses and purple fuchsia drops;<BR>
Camellias, which the gardener crops<BR>
To make the sickening wreaths that lie<BR>
On coffins when our loved ones die.<BR>
These all and many more were there;<BR>
Monsters and grandifloras rare,<BR>
With tropical broad leaves, grown rank,<BR>
Drinking the waters of the tank<BR>
Wherein the lotus-lilies bathe;<BR>
All curious forms of spur and spathe,<BR>
Pitcher and sac and cactus-thorn,<BR>
There in the fresh New England morn.<BR>
But where the sun came colored through<BR>
Translucent petals wet with dew,<BR>
The interspace was carpeted<BR>
With oriel lights and nodes of red,<BR>
Orange and blue and violet,<BR>
That wove strange figures, as they met,<BR>
Of airier tissue, brighter blooms<BR>
Than tumble from the Persian looms.<BR>
So at the pontiff's feasts, they tell,<BR>
From the board's edge the goblet fell,<BR>
Spilled from its throat the purple tide<BR>
And stained the pavement far and wide.<BR>
Such steps wise Sheba trod upon<BR>
Up to the throne of Solomon;<BR>
So bright the angel-crowded steep<BR>
Which Israel's vision scaled in sleep.<BR>
What one is she whose feet shall dare<BR>
Tread that illuminated stair?<BR>
Like Sheba, queen; like angels, fair?<BR>
Oh listen!  In the morning air<BR>
The blossoms all are hanging still&mdash;<BR>
The queen is standing on the sill.<BR>
No Sheba she; her virgin zone<BR>
Proclaims her royalty alone:<BR>
(Such royalty the lions own.)<BR>
Yet all too cheap the patterned stone<BR>
That paves kings' palaces, to feel<BR>
The pressure of her gaiter's heel.<BR>
The girlish grace that lit her face<BR>
Made sunshine in a dusky place&mdash;<BR>
The old silk hood, demure and quaint,<BR>
Wherein she seemed an altar-saint<BR>
Fresh-tinted, though in setting old<BR>
Of dingy carving and tarnished gold;<BR>
Her eyes, the candles in that shrine,<BR>
Making Madonna's face to shine.<BR>
Lingering I passed, but evermore<BR>
Abide with me the open door,<BR>
The doorsteps wide, the flowers that stand<BR>
In brilliant ranks on either hand,<BR>
The two white pillars and the vine<BR>
Of bitter-sweet and lush woodbine,<BR>
And&mdash;from my weary paths as far<BR>
As Sheba or the angels are&mdash;<BR>
Between, upon the wooden sill,<BR>
Thou, Queen of Hearts, art standing still.<BR>

Ancient city, down thy street<BR>
Minstrels make their music sweet;<BR>
Sound of bells is on the air,<BR>

And at night, when all are gone,<BR>
The waters in the dark sing on,<BR>
Till the moonrise and the breeze<BR>
Whiten the horse-chestnut trees.<BR>
Cool thou liest, leisured, slow,<BR>

Overlooking lands below<BR>
Terraced to thy green plateau.<BR>

Dear old city, it is long<BR>

At the ending of the street,<BR>
Where the chestnut branches meet;<BR>
Where, between the gay bazaars,<BR>
Maidens walk with eyes like stars,<BR>
And the slippered merchants go<BR>
On the pavements to and fro.<BR>
Upland winds blow through my sleep,<BR>
Moonrise glimmers, waters leap,<BR>
Till, awaking, thou dost seem<BR>
Like a city of a dream,&mdash;<BR>
Like a city of the air,<BR>
Builded high, aloof and fair,&mdash;<BR>
Such as childhood used to know<BR>
On the plains of long ago.<BR>

  NARCISSUS
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Where the black hemlock slants athwart the stream<BR>
He came to bathe; the sun's pursuing beam<BR>
Laid a warm hand upon him, as he stood<BR>
Naked, while noonday silence filled the wood.<BR>
Holding the boughs o'erhead, with cautious foot<BR>
He felt his way along the mossy root<BR>
That edged the brimming pool; then paused and dreamed.<BR>
Half like a dryad of the tree he seemed,<BR>
Half like the naiad of the stream below,<BR>
Suspended there between the water's flow<BR>
And the green tree-top world; the love-sick air<BR>
Coaxing with softest touch his body fair<BR>
A little longer yet to be content<BR>
Outside of its own crystal element.<BR>
And he, still lingering at the brink, looked down<BR>
And marked the sunshine fleck with gold the brown<BR>
And sandy floor which paved that woodland pool.<BR>
But then, within the shadows deep and cool<BR>
Which the close hemlocks on the surface made,<BR>
Two eyes met his yet darker than that shade<BR>
And, shining through the watery foliage dim,<BR>
Two white and slender arms reached up to him.<BR>
"Comest thou again, now all the woods are still,<BR>
Fair shape, nor even Echo from the hill<BR>
Calls her Narcissus?  Would her voice were thine,<BR>
Dear speechless image, and could answer mine!<BR>
Her I but hear and thee I may but see;<BR>
Yet, Echo, thou art happy unto me;<BR>
For though thyself art but a voice, sad maid,<BR>
Thy love the substance is and my love shade.<BR>
Alas! for never may I kiss those dumb<BR>
Sweet lips, nor ever hope to come<BR>
Into that shadow-world that lies somewhere&mdash;<BR>
Somewhere between the water and the air.<BR>
Alas! for never shall I clasp that form<BR>
That mocks me yonder, seeming firm and warm;<BR>
But if I leap to its embrace, the cold<BR>
And yielding flood is all my arms enfold.<BR>
All creatures else, save only me, can share<BR>
My beauties, be it but to stroke my hair,<BR>
Or hold my hand in theirs, or hear me speak.<BR>
The village wives will laugh and clap my cheek;<BR>
The forest nymphs will beg me for a kiss,<BR>
To make me blush, or hide themselves by this<BR>
Clear brook to see me bathe.  But I must pine,<BR>
Loving not me but this dear ghost of mine."<BR>
Then, bending down the boughs, until they dipped<BR>
Their broad green fronds, into the wave he slipped,<BR>
And, floating breast-high, from the branches hung,<BR>
His body with the current idly swung.<BR>
And ever and anon he caught the gleam<BR>
Of a white shoulder swimming in the stream,<BR>
Pressed close to his, and two young eyes of black<BR>
Under the dimpling surface answered back<BR>
His own, just out of kissing distance: then<BR>
The vain and passionate longing came again<BR>
Still baffled, still renewed: he loosed his hold<BR>
Upon the boughs and strove once more to fold<BR>
To his embrace that fine unbodied shape;<BR>
But the quick apparition made escape,<BR>
And once again his empty arms took in<BR>
Only the water and the shadows thin.<BR>
Thus every day, when noon lay bright and hot<BR>
On all the plains, there came to this cool spot,<BR>
Under the hemlocks by the deepening brook,<BR>
Narcissus, Phoebus' darling, there to look<BR>
And pore upon his picture in the flood:<BR>
Till once a peeping dryad of the wood,<BR>
Tracking his steps along the slender path<BR>
Which he between the tree trunks trodden hath,<BR>
Misses the boy on whom her amorous eyes<BR>
Where wont to feed; but where he stood she spies<BR>
A new-made yellow flower, that still doth seem<BR>
To woo his own pale reflex in the stream;<BR>
Whom Phoebus kisses when the woods are still<BR>
And only ceaseless Echo from the hill<BR>
Unprompted cries <I>Narcissus</I>!<BR>

  BEAVER POND MEADOW
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Thou art my Dismal Swamp, my Everglades:<BR>
Thou my Campagna, where the bison wades<BR>
Through shallow, steaming pools, and the sick air<BR>
Decays.  Thou my Serbonian Bog art, where<BR>
O'er leagues of mud, black vomit of the Nile,<BR>
Crawls in the sun the myriad crocodile.<BR>
Or thou my Cambridge or my Lincoln fen<BR>
Shalt be&mdash;a lonely land where stilted men<BR>
Stalking across the surface waters go,<BR>
Casting long shadows, and the creaking, slow<BR>
Canal-barge, laden with its marshy hay,<BR>
Disturbs the stagnant ditches twice a day.<BR>
Thou hast thy crocodiles: on rotten logs<BR>
Afloat, the turtles swarm and bask: the frogs,<BR>
When come the pale, cold twilights of the spring,<BR>
Like distant sleigh-bells through the meadows ring.<BR>
The school-boy comes on holidays to take<BR>
The musk-rat in its hole, or kill the snake,<BR>
Or fish for bull-heads in the pond at night.<BR>
The hog-snout's swollen corpse, with belly white,<BR>
I find upon the footway through the sedge,<BR>
Trodden by tramps along the water's edge.<BR>
Not thine the breath of the salt marsh below<BR>
Where, when the tide is out, the mowers go<BR>
Shearing the oozy plain, that reeks with brine<BR>
More tonic than the incense of the pine.<BR>
Thou art the sink of all uncleanliness,<BR>
A drain for slaughter-pens, a wilderness<BR>
Of trenches, pockets, quagmires, bogs where rank<BR>
The poison sumach grows, and in the tank<BR>
The water standeth ever black and deep<BR>
Greened o'er with scum: foul pottages, that steep<BR>
And brew in that dark broth, at night distil<BR>
Malarious fogs bringing the fever chill.<BR>
Yet grislier horrors thy recesses hold:<BR>
The murdered peddler's body five days old<BR>
Among the yellow lily-pads was found<BR>
In yonder pond: the new-born babe lay drowned<BR>
And throttled on the bottom of this moat,<BR>
Near where the negro hermit keeps his boat;<BR>
Whose wigwam stands beside the swamp; whose meals<BR>
It furnishes, fat pouts and mud-spawned eels.<BR>
Even so thou hast a kind of beauty, wild,<BR>
Unwholesome&mdash;thou the suburb's outcast child,<BR>
Behind whose grimy skin and matted hair<BR>
Warm nature works and makes her creature fair.<BR>
Summer has wrought a blue and silver border<BR>
Of iris flags and flowers in triple order<BR>
Of the white arrowhead round Beaver Pond,<BR>
And o'er the milkweeds in the swamp beyond<BR>
Tangled the dodder's amber-colored threads.<BR>
In every fosse the bladderwort's bright heads<BR>
Like orange helmets on the surface show.<BR>
Richer surprises still thou hast: I know<BR>
The ways that to thy penetralia lead,<BR>
Where in black bogs the sundew's sticky bead<BR>
Ensnares young insects, and that rosy lass,<BR>
Sweet Arethusa, blushes in the grass.<BR>
Once on a Sunday when the bells were still,<BR>
Following the path under the sandy hill<BR>
Through the old orchard and across the plank<BR>
That bridges the dead stream, past many a rank<BR>
Of cat-tails, midway in the swamp I found<BR>
A small green mead of dry but spongy ground,<BR>
Entrenched about on every side with sluices<BR>
Full to the brim of thick lethean juices,<BR>
The filterings of the marsh.  With line and hook<BR>
Two little French boys from the trenches took<BR>
Frogs for their Sunday meal and gathered messes<BR>
Of pungent salad from the water-cresses.<BR>
A little isle of foreign soil it seemed,<BR>
And listening to their outland talk, I dreamed<BR>
That yonder spire above the elm-tops calm<BR>
Rose from the village chestnuts of La Balme.<BR>
Yes, many a pretty secret hast thou shown<BR>
To me, O Beaver Pond, walking alone<BR>
On summer afternoons, while yet the swallow<BR>
Skimmed o'er each flaggy plash and gravelly shallow;<BR>
Or when September turned the swamps to gold<BR>
And purple.  But the year is growing old:<BR>
The golden-rod is rusted, and the red<BR>
That streaked October's frosty cheek is dead;<BR>
Only the sumach's garnet pompons make<BR>
Procession through the melancholy brake.<BR>
Lo! even now the autumnal wind blows cool<BR>
Over the rippled waters of thy pool,<BR>
And red autumnal sunset colors brood<BR>
Where I alone and all too late intrude.<BR>

  THE MERMAID'S GLASS
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
'T was down among the Thimble Isles<BR>
That strew for many "liquid miles"<BR>
The waters of Long Island Sound:<BR>
Our yacht lay in a cove; around<BR>
The rocky isles with cedars green<BR>
And channels winding in between:<BR>
And here a low, black reef was spread,<BR>
And there a sunken "nigger-head"<BR>
Dimpled the surface of the tide.<BR>
From one tall island's cliffy side<BR>
We heard the shaggy goats that fed:<BR>
The gulls wheeled screaming overhead<BR>
Or settled in a snowy flock<BR>
Far out upon the lonely rock<BR>
Which, like a pillar, seemed to show<BR>
Some drowned acropolis below.<BR>
Meanwhile, in the warm sea about,<BR>
With many a plunge and jolly shout,<BR>
Our crew enjoyed their morning bath.<BR>
The hairy skipper in his wrath<BR>
Lay cursing on the gunwale's rim:<BR>
He loved a dip but could not swim;<BR>
So, now and then with plank afloat<BR>
He'd struggle feebly round the boat<BR>
And o'er the side climb puffing in,<BR>
Scraping wide areas off his skin,<BR>
Then lie and sun each hirsute limb<BR>
Once more upon the gunwale's rim<BR>
And shout, with curses unavailing,<BR>
"Come out!  There's wind: let's do some sailing."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A palm-leaf hat, that here and there<BR>
Bobbed on the water, showed him where<BR>
Some venturous swimmer outward bound<BR>
Escaped beyond his voice's sound.<BR>
All heedless of their skipper's call,<BR>
One group fought for the upset yawl.<BR>
The conqueror sat astride the keel<BR>
And deftly pounded with his heel<BR>
The hands that clutched his citadel,<BR>
Which showed&mdash;at distance&mdash;like the shell<BR>
Round which, unseen, the Naiad train<BR>
Sport naked on the middle main.<BR>
Myself had drifted far away,<BR>
Meanwhile, from where the sail-boat lay,<BR>
Till all unbroken I could hear<BR>
The wave's low whisper in my ear,<BR>
And at the level of mine eye<BR>
The blue vibration met the sky.<BR>
Sometimes upon my back I lay<BR>
And watched the clouds, while I and they<BR>
Were wafted effortless along.&mdash;<BR>
Sudden I seemed to hear a song:<BR>
Yet not a song, but some weird strain<BR>
As though the inarticulate main<BR>
Had found a voice whose human tone<BR>
Interpreted its own dull moan;<BR>
Its foamy hiss; its surfy roar;<BR>
Its gentle lapping on the shore;<BR>
Its noise of subterranean waves<BR>
That grumble in the sea-cliff caves;<BR>
Its whish among the drifting miles<BR>
Of gulf-weed from the Indian Isles:&mdash;<BR>
All&mdash;all the harmonies were there<BR>
Which ocean makes with earth or air.<BR>
Turning I saw a sunken ledge<BR>
Bared by the ebb, along whose edge<BR>
The matted sea-weed dripped: thereon,<BR>
Betwixt the dazzle of the sun<BR>
And the blue shimmer of the sea,<BR>
I saw&mdash;or else I seemed to see<BR>
A mermaid, crooning a wild song,<BR>
Combing with arm uplifted long<BR>
The hair that shed its meshes black<BR>
Down the slope whiteness of her back.<BR>
She held a mirror in her hand,<BR>
Wherein she viewed sky, sea, and land,<BR>
Her beauty's background and its frame.<BR>
But now, as toward the rock I came,<BR>
All suddenly across the glass<BR>
Some startling image seemed to pass;<BR>
For her song rose into a scream,<BR>
Over her shoulders one swift gleam<BR>
Of eyes unearthly fell on me,<BR>
And, 'twixt the flashing of the sea<BR>
And the blind dazzle of the sun,<BR>
I saw the rock, but thereupon<BR>
She sat no longer 'gainst the blue;<BR>
Only across the reef there flew<BR>
One snow-white tern and vanished too.<BR>
But, coasting that lone island round,<BR>
Among the slippery kelp I found<BR>
A little oval glass that lay<BR>
Upturned and flashing in the ray<BR>
Of the down-looking sun.  Thereto<BR>
With scarce believing eyes I drew<BR>
And took it captive<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 10em">A while there</SPAN><BR>
I rested in the mermaid's lair,<BR>
And felt the merry breeze that blew,<BR>
And watched the sharpies as they flew,<BR>
And snuffed the sea's breath thick with brine,<BR>
And basked me in the sun's warm shine;<BR>
Then with my prize I made my way<BR>
Once more to where the sail-boat lay.<BR>
I kept the secret&mdash;and the glass;<BR>
By day across its surface pass<BR>
The transient shapes of common things<BR>
Which chance within its oval brings.<BR>
But when at night I strive to sound<BR>
The darkness of its face profound,<BR>
Again I seem to hear the breeze<BR>
That curls the waves on summer seas;<BR>
I see the isles with cedars green;<BR>
The channels winding in between;<BR>
The coves with beaches of white sand;<BR>
The reefs where warning spindles stand;<BR>
And, through the multitudinous shimmer<BR>
Of waves and sun, again the glimmer<BR>
Of eyes unearthly falls on me,<BR>
Deep with the mystery of the sea.<BR>

  THE IDEAS OF THE PURE REASON
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
I saw in dreams a constellation strange,<BR>
Thwarting the night; its big stars seemed to range<BR>
Northward across the zenith, and to keep<BR>
Calm footing along heaven's ridge-pole high,<BR>
While round the pole the sullen Bear did creep<BR>
And dizzily the wheeling spheres went by.<BR>
They from their watch-towers in the topmost sky<BR>
Looked down upon the rest,<BR>
Nor eastward swerved nor west,<BR>
Though Procyon's candle dipped below the verge,<BR>
And the great twins of Leda 'gan decline<BR>
Toward the horizon line,<BR>
And prone Orion, sprawling headlong, urge<BR>
His flight into the far Pacific surge.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I heard a voice which said: "Those wonders bright<BR>
Are hung not on the hinges of the night;<BR>
But set to vaster harmonies, they run<BR>
Straight on, and turn not with the turning sphere,<BR>
Nor make an orbit about any sun.<BR>
No glass can track the courses that they steer,<BR>
By what dark paths they vanish and appear.<BR>
The starry flocks that still<BR>
Are climbing heaven's hill<BR>
Will pasture westward down its sloping lawn;<BR>
But yon wild herd of planets,&mdash;who can say<BR>
Through what far fields they stray,<BR>
Around what focus their ellipse is drawn,<BR>
Whose shining makes their transcendental dawn?"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I told my vision to a learned man,<BR>
Who said: "On no celestial globe or plan<BR>
Can those unset, unrisen stars be found.<BR>
How might such uncomputed motions be<BR>
Among the ordered spheres?  Heaven's clock is wound<BR>
To keep one time.  Idle our dreams, and we,<BR>
Blown by the wind, as the light family<BR>
Of leaves."  But still I dream,<BR>
And still those planets seem<BR>
Through heaven their high, unbending course to take;<BR>
And a voice cries: "Freedom and Truth are we,<BR>
And Immortality:<BR>
God is our sun."  And though the morning break,<BR>
Across my soul still plays their shimmering wake.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
The warm wind comes in rushes,<BR>
The night is thick and sweet:<BR>
I cannot see the bushes&mdash;<BR>
The tall syringa bushes<BR>
Above the gate that meet,<BR>
Whose fallen blooms she crushes<BR>
Under her heedless feet;<BR>
But their heavy, rich perfume<BR>
Is round us in the gloom<BR>
Which lends its friendly cover<BR>
To bashful maid and lover:<BR>
Which cheats me of her blushes<BR>
But makes her kiss complete.<BR>
'Way down the village street<BR>
A lantern swings and dances<BR>
In front of the old church porch,<BR>
And throws its telltale glances<BR>
On the puddles and the plashes,<BR>
And flares in the wind like a torch,<BR>
And scatters sudden flashes<BR>
On the elm leaves overhead.<BR>
But you need have no dread<BR>
Of that harmless, far-off spark;<BR>
For the night is thick and dark,<BR>
O the dark is thick and sweet!<BR>
So, closer: let the beat<BR>
Of your heart encounter mine.<BR>
(How you tremble&mdash;like a leaf!)<BR>
O you do not need to fear<BR>
Any shame or any grief<BR>
While my arms around you twine<BR>
And the night wind pours its wine.<BR>
Come nearer, still more near;<BR>
Press closer, closer yet.<BR>
Your cheeks are warm and wet,<BR>
Like this wind from out the south,<BR>
And warm and wet your mouth;<BR>
And yon lantern won't discover<BR>
The maiden and her lover.<BR>
'Tis only the sexton, nothing more&mdash;<BR>
There was a funeral to-day&mdash;<BR>
The sexton locking the church door,<BR>
Locking it up and going away.<BR>
Why should it fall on a day like this?<BR>
What has death to do in a world of bliss?<BR>

Swelling the blood in the vein,<BR>
Filling the rivers and springs:<BR>
Whisper the girl at my side,<BR>
Quicken her pulse with thy breath,<BR>

Teach her to take and to give.<BR>
